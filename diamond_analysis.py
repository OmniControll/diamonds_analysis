# Business Question: 
# How do the physical attributes and quality grades of a diamond relate to its market price, 
# can we accurately predict the price of a diamond based on these features?"

# so we have 10 columns ; 8 numeric and 2 categorical. [carat, depth, table, price, x, y, z] are numeric and [cut, color, clarity] are categorical.

#General Notes:
#on clarity feature: I1 (worst), SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (best)
# the table, x y and z imply the dimensions of the diamond.
# the depth is the height of the diamond, which is the z divided by the average of x and y.
# the table is the width of the diamond's table expressed as a percentage of its average diameter.
# the density of the diamond is the mass divided by the volume.
# the mass of the diamond is the density times the volume.
# the volume of the diamond is the product of x, y and z.

# So what do we want to know about this data?

# We'll check the distributions of the numeric features and see if there are any outliers.
# we can use the dimensions to calculate the volume of the diamond and use that as a feature.
# we can also use the dimensions to calculate the density of the diamond and use that as a feature.
