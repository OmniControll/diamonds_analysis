# diamonds_analysis
exploratory analysis of given diamonds dataset
data analysis and machine learning pipeline aimed at understanding and predicting the market price of diamonds based on their physical attributes and quality grades. This project leverages comprehensive data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and feature engineering to build a robust predictive model.

Key Objectives:

Data Extraction & Cleaning: Python libraries such as Pandas and NumPy to load the diamonds dataset, handle byte string conversions, and preprocess categorical variables for seamless analysis.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough EDA using Seaborn and Matplotlib to visualize data distributions, identify patterns, and detect outliers, providing valuable insights into the factors influencing diamond prices.

Feature Engineering: Transform and engineer new features like volume and density from existing dimensions to enhance model performance and gain deeper understanding of the data.
Data Visualization: Create insightful visualizations to illustrate the distribution of key features and the relationships between them, aiding in informed decision-making for model development.
